# Introduction

This is the documentation for the API of
[CompanyMood](https://www.company-mood.com).

This API follows the [JSONAPI specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/) but without hypermedia.

There are a lot of different libraries for all kinds of languages out there to consume JSON-API APIs.

# API Request and Versions

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: api.company-mood.com
Accept: application/vnd.company-mood-v2+json
```

You need to specify the API version you want use via the `Accept`
header.

Format

`application/vnd.company-mood-v<VERSION>+json`

# Application Token

```http

Host: api.company-mood.com
X-App-Token: 27f50875-9a43-4d6c-a376-6968f09858db

You need to send your application token with every request in the
`X-App-Token` header.
